      Bootstrap{"'"}s styling and layout can be applied to a wide range of
      markup structures. This documentation aims to provide developers with best
      practice examples to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap itself and
      illustrate appropriate semantic markup, including ways in which potential
      accessibility concerns can be addressed.
